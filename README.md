# Java SE Programmer 17 (Oracle Certified Associate) Syllabus

## Handling Data Types and Values

- [x] Use primitives 
- [x] wrapper classes, 
- [x] Math API, 
- [x] parentheses, 
- [x] type promotion, and 
- [x] casting to evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions
- [x] Manipulate text using String and StringBuilder classes
- [ ] Manipulate date, time, duration, period, instant, and time-zone objects using Date-Time API

## Controlling Program Flow

- [x] Create program flow control constructs, including if/else, switch statements, and expressions, loops, and break and continue statements

## Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach

- [ ] Declare and instantiate Java objects, including nested class objects
- [x] Explain the object life-cycle, including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection
- [x] Create classes and records, define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers
- [x] Implement overloading, including var-arg methods
- [x] Understand variable scopes, use local variable type inference, apply encapsulation, and make objects immutable
- [ ] Implement inheritance, including abstract and **sealed classes**. Override methods, including that of the **Object class**
- [ ] Implement polymorphism, *differentiate object type versus reference type*. Perform type casting, identify object types using instanceof operator and **pattern matching**
- [x] Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods
- [ ] Create and use **enumerations with fields, methods, and constructors**

## Handling Exceptions

- [ ] Handle exceptions using try/catch/finally, **try-with-resources**, and multi-catch blocks, including custom exceptions

## Working with Arrays and Collections

- [ ] **Create Java arrays, List, Set, Map, and Deque collections, and manipulate their elements**

## **Working with Streams and Lambda Expressions**

- [ ] Use Java object and primitive Streams, including lambda expressions implementing functional interfaces, to manipulate data
- [ ] Perform decomposition, concatenation and reduction, and grouping and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams

## **Packaging and Deploying Java Code and Using the Java Platform Module System**

- [ ] Define modules and their dependencies, expose module content including for reflection. Define services, producers, and consumers
- [ ] Compile Java code, produce modular and non-modular JARs, runtime images, and implement migration using unnamed and automatic modules

## **Managing Concurrent Code Execution**

- [ ] Create worker threads using Runnable and Callable, manage the thread lifecycle, including automations provided by different Executor services and concurrent API
- [ ] Develop thread-safe code, using different locking mechanisms and concurrent API
- [ ] Process Java collections concurrently, including the use of parallel streams

## **Using Java I/O API**

- [ ] Read and write console and file data using I/O Streams
- [ ] Serialize and de-serialize Java objects
- [ ] Create, traverse, read, and write Path objects and their properties using java.nio.file API

## **Accessing Databases Using JDBC**

- [ ] Create connections, create and execute basic, prepared and callable statements, process query results and control transactions using JDBC API

## **Implementing Localization**

- [ ] Implement localization using locales, resource bundles, parse and format messages, dates, times, and numbers including currency and percentage values

## Additional Concepts

- [ ] **Understand the basics of Java Logging API**
- [ ] Use Annotations such as Override, FunctionalInterface, Deprecated, SuppressWarnings, and **SafeVarargs**
- [ ] Use generics, including wildcards

**Note:**
- Missing package and import statements: Assume all sample code is in the same package or has necessary import statements.
- No file or directory path names for classes: Assume one of the given scenarios for code compilation and execution.
- Unintended line breaks: Assume that the wrapping is an extension of the same line.
- Code fragments: Assume supporting code exists for the correct compilation and execution of the code.
